Some code to interact with ZTF lightcurves and matchfiles

- ZTF_LCquery can be used to get lightcurves for a set of Ra,Decs (on supernova, from the matchfiles)
- ZTF_matchfile_query contains the main code that does this
- plot_LC.py is a simple script that takes the lightcurves and plots them (and period searches them, not very robust, just a quick and dirty piece of code).
